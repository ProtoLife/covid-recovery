Mon 21 Dec

1. Updates databases, changed final date to Dec 18, reran data_base.ipynb (./pks/data_base_all.pk)
	- note former data.ipynb (./pks/data_all.pk) runs with errors in cell 4, bcountries not defined, deprecated
2. Changed mindays to +12 (252) : renamed data_cluster-alt.ipynb to data_cluster_alt.ipynb, ran data_cluster_alt.ipynb creating 8 cluster data files .pk
3. Checked that data names and population and det corrections are working properly: added print statements (now commented out) and additional error trap
4. Added check 'all' box to toggle all params checked/unchecked.
5. Added iteration count and residual display widgets for some feedback during fitting and after.
6. Found that these two widgets and the Textbox widgets all display badly in Safari, but OK in Chrome. It is not widget height.
7. Tried to fix with https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Widget%20Styling.ipynb. 
    - worked out that problem could be the height of the description part : if we could change font size it might work in Safari.
8. Captured intermediate parameters in statically updating table in output text window (using output redirection and pretty_print in cb_iter)
9. Hide iteration counter widget to make display more compact (can be reactivated from comment if needed), and increase output text window to 600 px
    - need to make text area longer to display all parameters updating during fit
